Summary and licensing information
======================================
This code is for RAVEN II surgical simulator. It is based on the open-source RAVEN II control software, developed by the University of Washington Biorobotics lab at: https://github.com/uw-biorobotics/raven2/tree/indigo. It enables running RAVEN control software with no robotic hardware attached.

A Python script (Real_Packet_Generator_Surgeon.py) mimicks the network packets sent from the surgeon console based on a previously collected data from the trajectory of a basic surgical task. A 3D visualization tool for ROS (rviz package) is used for 3D animation of the robotic motions.

How to run
======================================
Setting up the repository:
0. Clone the repository:
   "git clone https://github.com/CSLDepend/raven2_sim.git"
1. Rename the folder name from "raven2_sim" to "raven_2"
2. Change the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variable to the location of raven_2 folder. For example:
   "export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/raven/raven_2:/home/raven/raven_2/raven_visualization:/opt/ros/indigo/share:/opt/ros/indigo/stacks"
   To test if the change was made successfully, run "roscd raven_2" and you should be relocated to the raven_2 folder.
4. Run "tar zxvf ./teleop_data/new_test_data.tgz" to unzip the datafiles used by the packet generator

Running RAVEN simulator
1. Goto raven_2 folder:  "roscd raven_2"
2. Simple simulator:     "python run.py sim 1 none"
   Dynamic simulator:    "python run.py dyn_sim 1 none"
   Robot /w packet-gen:  "python run.py rob 1 none"
   Robot /w surgeon-gui: "python run.py rob 0 none"
