Summary and licensing information
======================================
This code is for RAVEN II surgical simulator. It is based on the open-source RAVEN II control software, developed by the University of Washington Biorobotics lab at: https://github.com/uw-biorobotics/raven2/tree/indigo. It enables running RAVEN control software with no robotic hardware attached.

A Python script (Real_Packet_Generator_Surgeon.py) mimicks the network packets sent from the surgeon console based on a previously collected data from the trajectory of a basic surgical task. A 3D visualization tool for ROS (rviz package) is used for 3D animation of the robotic motions.
