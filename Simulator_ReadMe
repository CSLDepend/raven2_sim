Set the virtual machine to at least have 2GB of memory

1. Install Ubunto
2. Install Realtime Linux kernel: http://brl.ee.washington.edu/ravenIIwiki/index.php/NewComputerSetup - Option 1

   //Option 2: 
   //You should also install "patch-3.14.3-rt5.patch.xz" from https://  www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/3.14/older/
   
   You should restart Linux in order to see the new kernel in effect.

3. You should "gksudo gedit /etc/security/limits.conf"¬ù as follows to allow memory allocation and real-time priorities in VM:
   *            -       memlock         1048576
   *            -       rtprio          99

   You should logout and login again for the changes to take effect.
   Then Test if they are set correctly with these commands:
        ulimit -r
        ulimit -l


4. Install ROS Indigo
	1. Download Github Indigo
	   Unpack it to a folder on your Ubunto

	2. Rename the folder to Raven_2

	3. Include raven_2 path in the environment variable ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:
           ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:/home/homa/Documents/raven_2

    4. make clean
	   make 
      (If you got permission denied error, do sudo chmod a+x on that file)
	   roslaunch raven_2 raven_2.launch
